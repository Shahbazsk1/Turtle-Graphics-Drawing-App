# Turtle-Graphics-Drawing-App
<h2><p>This project is a Turtle Graphics Keyboard-Controlled Drawing App built using Python's turtle module. </p>
<p>It allows the user to control a turtle (cursor) on the screen using keyboard keys to simulate drawing and navigation a basic implementation of interactive canvas control.</p></h2>

<h3>Project Details & Functionality</h3>
<h4>Navigation with Keyboard:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>W: Move forward.</li>
  <li>S: Move backward.</li>
  <li>A: Turn left (rotate turtle left by 10°).</li>
  <li>D: Turn right (rotate turtle right by 10°).</li>
  <li>C: Clear the screen and reset turtle to the home position (center).</li>
</ul>

<h4>Turtle Drawing:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The turtle moves in the direction it is facing and draws a line as it moves (unless the pen is lifted).</li>
</ul>

<h4>Screen Behavior:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>screen.listen() keeps the window active to listen for key events.</li>
  <li>screen.exitonclick() allows you to close the window by clicking on it.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Modules Used</h3>
<ul>
  <li>turtle: Built-in Python module for graphics and basic GUI-like drawing.</li>
  <li>No installation needed — it's part of Python's standard library.</li>
</ul>
